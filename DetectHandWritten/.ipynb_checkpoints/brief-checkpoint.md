    "\n",
    "Mr Pontier is back and needs your help. This times, he needs to automatically detect hand-written digits written on pictures that represents the phone numbers of his clients and collaborators.\n",
    "Because he has thousands of documents, this will take far too long to do it manually. This is why he asked you if you can design an algorithm that automatically detect the number from the pictures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, Mr Pontier wants\n",
    "* to understand how the algorithm works,\n",
    "* to compare the performance with several classification algorithms \n",
    "* to observe the convergence of a grandient descent algorithm for further investigation.\n",
